# Creating a developer wiki

## Goal

We are going to create website to host your own cheatsheets and articles, blog
posts, your project portfolio, a link collection and many more things. Don't
hesitate to customize and expand it to make it your own. The goal is for you to
create your own online space as a software developer to collect resources and
content that's relevant to you and to share it with others.
