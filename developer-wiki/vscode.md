# VS Code: The software development toolkit

## Software Development Setup

### File Explorer

Keep an overview of the repository

### Code Editor

Write and edit individual source code files

### Terminal

Run commands to start your application, create or manipulate files,
download and install source code libraries and trigger a build process
(compilation)

### Debugger & Running Application

For manual testing and to debug your application

### Documentation

Reading documentation and accessing the reference of the tools one is using is
an essential part of software development

## VS Code UI Tour

- Editor (main window)
- Sidebar (left or right)
  - File Explorer
  - Search
  - Git Version Control
  - Debugger
  - Extensions
- Panel (bottom)
  - Terminal
  - Debug Console
  - Output
  - Problems
- Status Bar (very bottom)
  - Language Mode
  - Encoding
- Command Palette (overlay popup)

## Keyboard vs Mouse

What are the advantages of using the keyboard to perform a specific action over
using the mouse. When is it better to use the mouse and when is it better to use
the keyboard? What are the differences in their characteristics.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Key Modifiers

- Command (Mac)
- Option (Mac) / Alt (Win)
- Control (Win & Mac)

As a guideline most key commands which work with the command key on mac, work
with control on windows.

Sometimes you will find commands that are mapped to **key sequences**. These are
two keyboard shortcuts that have to be executed immediately after each other to
trigger a command.

## Opening Folders

In contrast to other programs like Microsoft Word, VS Code is not made to open
individual files. Instead it is meant to open repositories, i.e. an entire
directory.
It's really important to keep track of the currently opened folder in VS Code
and to be able to tell the difference between

## Summary

VS Code is a very minimal but powerful central hub for an efficent software
development workflow. It integrates all essential tools needed for software
development in a way that stays true to their original form.

Mastering VS Code will greatly improve the speed and ease you can reach while
developing software.

We should be aiming to rely as little as possible on the mouse as possible while
developing software.

Essential Rule:

Always fall back to the Command Palette, when you can't remember a specific
keyboard shortcut, before you reach to your mouse.

It's important to keep track of all the source code repositories on your system.
One way to do so is to create a subdirectory in your user home directory called
**Developer**, which contains all your repositories.

## Exercises

- Tryout the keyboard shortcuts from the welcome page
- Use the command palette to change your color scheme
- Install the prettier code extension
- Create a Developer folder in your home directory
- Create a new repository called `developer-wiki`, open it in VS code and add
  some files
- Create a dock / task bar entry for VS Code, so you can open it quickly.

## Check Questions

- Can you name the essential tools necessary for software development and
  explain what their job is?
- What rule can you follow to make sure your keyboard shortcut repertoire in VS
  Code will constantly grow?
- What is the purpose of the Developer folder?
- Why do we use VS Code to open entire folders instead of individual files?
- How can you check which folder is currently opened in VS Code?
- How can you lookup a keyboard shortcut in VS Code?
- What's the best method to quickly open a file within VS Code?

## Open Exercises

- Train to move through the VS Code window without moving the mouse.
  - Open and close the side bar.
  - Open the explorer
  - Open a file in the repository
  - Jump to the editor
  - Close the editor window
  - Open another file
  - Open the terminal
  - Jump back to the explorer
  - Jump to the editor
- Write your own personal list of important keyboard shortcuts in the
  `developer-wiki`
- Go on the hunt for some nice extensions. Create another entry in your
  developer wiki, where you keep track of your favorite vscode extensions.
- Train touch typing with [keybr](https://www.keybr.com) or [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/)
- Add more notes in your developer wiki. Create individual files for each topic.
