## Summary

Software craftsmanship is about passion. Software craftsmen are passionate about
software development and their profession. They are passionate about solving
problems with simple solutions. They are passionate about helping the software
industry to evlove; sharing their code; mentoring young developers; sharing their
epxeriences via blogs, books, talks, videos and conversations; and being active
in technical communities. Software craftsmen are humble, always ready to learn
from more-experienced developers and eager to help the less experienced.

Software craftsmen are on a mission. They focus on bettering themselves,
constantly investing in their own careers, and learning, teaching, sharing, and
delivering value to every single client. But this mission is not just about
clients -- that's just one part of it. The real mission of a software craftsman
is to make a contribution to raise the bar of the software industry, with
professionalism, passion and care. Software craftsmen are more than just
ordinary developers who are hired to do a job. Craftsmen focus on helping other
developers to get better at their craft and to be proud of what they do and who
they are. The goal is that, one day, the quality and success rate of software
project around the world will be at a far higher rate than they are today.

Being a software craftsman is about more than just waking up in the morning,
going to work and getting paid to do some _stuff_. Software craftsmen wake up in
the morning to make things better and to change the world we live in. Being a
software craftsman is far more than writing well-crafted code or being a
software developer. It's a lifestyle - a commitment to excellence. Embrace it.
Be proud of the role you play in the evolution of our society.
