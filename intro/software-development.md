# Software development mechanics

## Leading question: How can you develop a software?

## Definition: develop

- To make visible or manifest
- To work out the possibilities of
- To create or produce especially by deliberate effort over time
- To make active
- To make available or usable
- To make suitable for commercial purposes
- To cause to evolve or unfold gradually: to lead or conduct through a succession of states or changes each of which is preparatory for the next
- To expand by a process of growth

## Source Code

Source code (also referred to as source or code) is the version of software as
it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in plain text
(i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters).

For the purpose of clarity "source code" is taken to mean any fully executable
description of a software system.

The relation between source code and software can be compared to:

- Recipe -> Cooked dish
- Sheet music -> Music performance / recording
- Blueprint -> Building

## Plain text files

A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a
computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can
information be written to a computer file.

You can picture a file as a list of bytes, stored on a hard drive.

In a plain text file the bytes of the file represent characters from a character
set. The mapping from bytes to characters and back is called a character
encoding. The most basic and widely used character encoding is ASCII (American
Standard Code for Information Interchange)

[Ascii

In contrast to a word document a plain text format contains only a string of
characters and no formatting (except for tabs and new line characters)

## Programming Language

A programming language is a language designed for the purpose of writing
instructions for a computer in a human-readable manner.

In constrast to a natural language there is very little room for ambiguities and
errors. Any single instruction that is slightly misinterpreted by a computer
could potentially break the whole program. This is why the grammar and syntactic
rules of a programming language are much stricter and narrower than in a natural
language like german or english.

This narrowness also simplifies the implementation of a compiler or other tools
which understand or transform source code written in the programming language.

## Compilation

The process of converting source code written in a programming language into
another language. The programm doing this translation is called a compiler.

The compilation target is often a machine language that can be
directly fed to a CPU, but can also be some other programming language.

## Repository

A directory filled with source code files. Every project has a separate
repository.

[Examples: GitHub](https://github.com)

## Summary

Software development means editing text files. These text files are written in
made up languages and are meant to be translated into an executable format using
a compiler.

## Check questions

- Why is source code written as plain text files and not as formatted text?
- How can text be represented using bits?
- What is the job of a compiler?
- Are there programming languages which don't need a compiler?
- What is the purpose of organizing source code in repositories?

## Terminology

- Source Code
- Character Encoding
- ASCII
- Plain Text
- File
- Compilation
- Interpreter
- Programming Language

## Open Exercises

- Scroll through Learn X in Y Minutes and explore the different programming languages.
- Study the structure of the ASCII table. Can you make sense of why it is
  designed the way it is?
- Scroll through GitHub and look for popular repositories in different languages
  and browse through the directory structure.
