### Memory Units

1 nibble = 4 bits

1 byte = 8 bits

1 word = 32 bits / 64bits (amount of memory a CPU can read / write)

1 kilo byte = 1000 bytes

1 mega byte = 1000000 bytes

1 giga byte = 1000000000 bytes

1 tera byte = 1000000000000 bytes

### Summary

One of the primary challenges of programming is to represent information in a
format that can be implemented as bits. We have to **encode** the
information we care about as bits before the computer can process it.

The most frequent kind of information a computer has to deal with are positive
integer numbers. Those can be represented using a base 2 digit system, which is
also called **binary**

### Check questions

- What is one bit?
- How many hex digits are necessary to represent one byte.
- How many bytes are 64bits?
- How many bits are in 100Mb?
- What is 0xff (hex) in binary and decimal?
- Write the numbers up to 20 in base 7
- What is 11110000 (binary) in hexadecimal?
- What is 110101 (binary) in decimal?

### Terminology

- Bit
- Byte
- Kilo, mega, tera
- Decimal
- Binary
- Hexadecimal

### Open Challenges / Exercises

- Count in binary with your fingers. Try to keep track of the scores in some
  fast paced agems, like thumb wrestling or rock paper scissors.
- Write down the numbers from 0 to some arbitrary number in binary, hex and decimal
- Pick a random number in either binary, hex, decimal and convert it into the
  other two formats.
